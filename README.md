Happy Hour 

1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? 
  I will be using React, Node, and Firebase for my final project.  

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
  The front end is going to be the main focus with the backend mainly being set up just for the database.

3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
  I want to make a single page application that will eventually be turned into a fully functioning app using react native. 

4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
  I want to create an app that lets you see all of the happy hours in your area and be able to filter by different alcohols. Eventually I want to be able to have a calendar with events like wine festivals.

5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
  Mainly college age adults 21-30. 

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.
  I want to use the google maps and places API to find business near me and my own API to record data such as users and the happy hours of the locations to display.

7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
  The basic schema of the database with consist of users with a business user account to access more information and display custom information. 

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially
important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces
notoriously messy data.
  I might have issues with the API being down. The API may be limited in the way I want to pull data. 

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
  I need to secure my API key and the information of business and users that I may collect. 

d. What functionality will your app include?
  The basic functionality will be a map that displays bars based off of filters that you can apply. There will also be the functionality to make a user account to save the calendar events.

e. What will the user flow look like?
  The basic user flow will either be to go to the app and filter by either location or current user location. This will display all of the bars based off of the filters. The user can look at each and compare what they would prefer

f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your
stretch goals?
  My site will include current google data based off of places. The map will be the main feature and the components built to display the place data. I want to eventually add the calendar and event finding. My far stretch goals include having businesses work with me to have private events exclusive to only members that use the app.
